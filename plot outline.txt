1) [The Player somehow helps with the final stages of Deep Sky's development of the Power Armor H2H outfit]

2) The Player goes to Harmony to meet with monk Brother Greg and a teenage pirate girl named Arianne [name is subject to change]
3) Arianne explains to the Player about how a wormhole recently appeared in the Durax System, one jump from Stormhold, but only someone with a jump-capable ship can go anywhere on the other side.
4) Arianne and the Player go to Stormhold to discuss stuff with Owen Diedrich, one of the big-shot Pirate leaders there, who in particular has taken up handling the issue.
5) The Player and Owen Diedrich discuss [stuff].
6) The Player goes through the Wormhole of Truth in the Durax system.

7) [missing "antfolk intro missions" content]
8) The Player goes to Tarazed Corporation and gets Hyperdrive Educational Models one at a time and delivers them to Beob Sb Evtva one at a time.
	8.1) This will work on a counter kind of like the Unfettered Jump Drive missions.
		8.1.1) It will be 3.
9) The Antfolk invent the Hyperdrive and start mass producing them.
	9.1) This will happen on some event timer that starts right when the Hyperdrive Model Counter completes.
[transition section]
10) The Player receives the Antfolk License next visit after the Antfolk begin mass producing Hyperdrives.
11) The Antfolk colonize [nearby star systems].
	11.1) [Will be using periodic timed events for this.]
12) The Antfolk ask the Player for the knowledge to terraform planets to make them more habitable and therefore able to sustain a higher population.
	12.1) The Player explains how Humans usually do it to the best of their ability. The Antfolk say something like “We couldn't have thought of a less efficient way to do that if we tried! Please go find a better way!”
13) So the Player goes to Rand to look for Amy. They find out that Amy is now teaching terraforming, working under Ijs at the Conservatory on Winter.
	13.1) The Player goes to the Conservatory on Winter to speak with Amy. It turns out her full name is “Amy Su”.
	13.2) The Player has to convince a now-arrogant and attention hog-ish Amy Su to help with the Antfolk.
		13.2.1) Patronizing Choice
			13.2.1.1) The Player gets Amy to do what the Player wants by giving her a reality check. The Player does something to shame Amy and then comes back later to explain why they did what they did.
			13.2.1.2) Possible Conversation Snip-it
				13.2.1.2.1) Context: The Player is publicly embarrassing Amy Su to smash her oversized ego.
							<name>: Kid, you're nothing more than a college dropout who just so happened to have the spine to say 'throwing asteroids at planets changes their climates'. That's all.
							Amy: Oh yeah, and what are you without your ship?
							<name>: Billionaire War Hero Alpha Slayer.
			13.2.1.3) While the Player waits for Amy to chill and get a cool head again, the Antfolk are continuing to expand
			13.2.1.4) set patronizing
		13.2.2) Manipulating Choice
			13.2.2.1) The Player gets Amy to do what the Player wants by appealing to her pride. Emphasizing how she's the only one who can help the Antfolk with this terribly important problem, etc.
			13.2.2.2) During this branch of the story, Amy makes some mistake at a critical time because of her arrogant pride.
			13.2.2.3) set manipulative
14) The Player brings Amy to Antfolk space, but stops by the Pug world nearby to ask for a second Pug Translation Machine.
	14.1) has patronizing
		14.1.1) Amy considers changing her mind about helping because of the Pug War, but reluctantly accepts the translator and agrees to continue to Planet Beob Sb Evtva.
15) The Player + Amy Su land on Beob Sb Evtva. Amy introduces herself to the Antfolk ambassador they send.
16) The Player escorts Amy in collecting data on what the ideal environment is for the Antfolk.
	16.1) Side Note: Planet Beob Sb Evtva is extremely similar to how Earth was in the Devonian Period.
17) The Player leaves Ussria with Amy, escorting an Antfolk bioship (maintaining an open comm link with PC and carrying sensors for "watching and learning"), to the planet Beob ss Vefgp Bybal, still in the Terngq Nlf Gne System.
18) Terraforming Beob ss Vefgp Bybal
	18.1) has patronizing
		18.1.1) Amy does an atmospheric analysis and geological survey of Planet Beob ss Vefgp Bybal with the Player's ship’s sensors.
		18.1.2) [Amy terraforms Planet Beob ss Vefgp Bybal]
19) The Player and Amy realize that she shouldn't just do all the Antfolk’s terraforming for them forever. She needs to take on Antfolk apprentices, which means living on an Antfolk world, most likely Beob Sb Evtva, which means the Antfolk need to know how to design living spaces designed for humans.
20) [arc where PC obtains blueprints of a human luxury apartment complex for the Antfolk, and the Antfolk use them to build the "Palace of the Giants" {<-- name is open for negotiation}]
21) [Transition Section]
22) [The Player gives the Antfolk energy shielding technology]
	22.1) [This needs to be somehow way more complicated to do than it really should be.]
23) [Transition Section]
24) The Antfolk Union-Korath Exiles War
25) [Transition Section]
26) Epilogue
	26.1) The Player brings Amy Su back to Winter.
#everything after this, if disapproved of by MZ, will be removed to be put in some supplementary mod that would be seperate from, but dependant on, "Bite of the Ant". A "Bite of the Ant: Supplement" mod or something.
	26.2) (Optionally) Secret Ending
		26.2.1) When the Player next lands on Harmony, they are given a choice to speak with Brother Greg about the Pug and the Antfolk. While there, PC shows Brother Greg a copy of all of PC's Captain's Log entries from starting the mission "Missive from Harmony 1" to completing the main plotline of the mod, combined with all of the <ship>'s relevant sensor logs.
			26.2.1.1) Note: PC should get a choice to say why PC is doing this, but it likely won't end up affecting the epilogue's plot much.
		26.2.2) After PC leaves and without PC's knowledge, one of the other monks from Brother Greg's monestary ghostwrites the PC's Captain's Logs and ship sensor data into a sort of "Race Shepharding 101" book, but with heavy religious tones, called "The Book of <first>".
			26.2.2.1) This will be represented by an event with a delay of 730 days (two in-game years) until the book is completed.
		26.2.3) Once the Book of <first> is published, there will be a series of events connected to random semi-mutually exclusive missions of increasing probability for PC to get in which PC gets recognized by some follower.
			26.2.3.1) Upon the occurance of the last "growing follower base" event, there will be a mission with 100% chance of occuring anywhere Human populations can be found, lore-wise (including Allhome in Hai space and Humanika in Quarg space), where upon landing, PC is beset with devout followers.
		26.2.4) PC will have to make multiple choices about how to deal with their exponentially growing follower base. [what those choices will be has yet to be decided]
