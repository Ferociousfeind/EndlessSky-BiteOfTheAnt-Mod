	description "The Battle Larva is a small and highly maneuverable fightercraft. Its lightweight and compact design is made possible through the use of incredibly low mass, high strength biomaterials and the simple fact that Antfolk don't need as large a cockpit as humans do."

	description "The Slave Maker has been the primary transport vessel of the Antfolk ever since they achieved space flight. Mainly used for the purpose of transporting Antfolk from planet to planet, the Slave Maker is capable of carrying hundreds of Antfolk, but as a result is rather slow and has few defenses."

	description "Much like the Slave Maker, the Honey Pot has been in use for some time. While the carrying capacity of the Honey Pot is rather low by Antfolk freighter standards, any Human able to see just how much cargo that the Honey Pot is able to carry would be astonished. This is because of the Honey Pot's ability to adjust its internal structure with ease while dealing no damage to hull integrity, allowing the packing of much more cargo than would be thought possible."

	description "After beginning to colonize more systems, the Antfolk were in serious need of bigger and better freighters to be able to transport the huge amounts of cargo needed to colonize planets. As such, the Antfolk developed the Leaf Cutter. This heavy freighter holds the same bioship capabilities that make the Honey Pot so efficient, allowing the Leaf Cutter to hold unfathomable amounts of cargo."

	description "The Fire Frigate is a small, light craft that can barely be considered a warship. Slower only than the Battle Larvae, the Fire Frigate is normally used as an escort craft to defend transport ships and freighters from any marauding pirates while traveling between planets, or to simply distract them if needed. The frigate has just enough armaments to deal with two or three Battle Larve, but beyond that has trouble in defending itself without back up."

	description "As a response to an increase in Antfolk pirate activity after the discovery of the Hyperdrive, the Army Cruiser is the first Antfolk ship created for pure combat. A step up in size and power compared to the Fire Frigate, the cruiser is considerably less manueverable, while boasting not only increased fire power and hull strength, but also integrated shield technology, something that older ships do not have. This allows it to last longer in sustained battle while also cleaning up targets far quicker."

	description "Battle Larva, being too small to equip their own Hyperdrive, require a larger ship to carry them between systems. As a result, the Antfolk developed the Queen Carrier. While completely defenseless on its own, the Queen Carrier is able to carry upwards of 20 fighters in its large hangar bays. That much fire power is able to overpower almost any ship, quickly picking away at the shields and hull of anyone unfortunate enough to be in the way."

	description "The Bullet Battleship is the pinacle of Antfolk technology. Large and intimidating, this hulking beast has the most potential firepower of any single Antfolk ship, able to single handedly take down multiple Army Cruisers or Fire Frigates. The biggest advantage that this ship has is its comparatively massive self repair rate. The Antfolk have developed a special steroid serum specifically for Bullet Battleships, allowing the ship to heal considerably more quickly than other Antfolk bio-ships."
