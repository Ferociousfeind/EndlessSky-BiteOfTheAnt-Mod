While staring at the decorations, a small group of Antfolk (no more than ten) approach you and say "<first> Captain <name> is [in awe/amazed by] the decorations. This pleases [me/us/this one]. Do you wish to learn about the holiday that is the Aniversary of Miasma's Defeat?"`
			`Do you? This could be a chance to learn more about Antfolk religion and culture, which theoretically would help in interacting with them.  Or it could turn out to be a complete waste of time.`
			choice
				`Yeah, sure. Why not? Tell me about Miasma.`

				`The Antfolk explains "You see, back in very ancient times, Antfolk believed that demons came from a [hell/prison] below Ussria's surface. However, we soon learned that demons don't come from below, they come from above. A millenia ago, a massive metal monster descended from the skies. It burned the land and boiled the seas. Our only salvation from its wrath came when our [deity/goddess], the mighty {Giant Sky Spider}, also came down from the [skies/heavens] and banished Miasma from our world. It then gave us the sacred [Pipe Organ] of Spirits and instructed us in its proper use to prevent the return of Miasma.`
				`[I/we/this one] was just on [my/our] way to the festival celebrating and observing the Anniversary of Miasma's Defeat. Do you wish to come?`
				choice
					`Alright. I'll come.`
