It is a very insectoid mix of vocalized clicks, body language, and pheromone communication. To translate it into an entirely vocal language like your own, and back, you will require much more than what the Hai use.

			`Groggily, you open your bay doors. A single Pug is standing there, in some kind of uniform. You never were good at telling individual Pug apart, but you suspect that this Pug is female.`
			`"Can I help you?" you ask.`
			`"We have elected to send one of us as a passenger on your ship, to provide useful advice when necessary," the Pug said.`

			`The Pug made a sound vaguely reminiscent of laughing. "How do you expect to speak with the Chordi life forms?"`
			`"Right. You haven't given me that translation machine yet," you say.`
			`"That's not all that needs doing. The Antfolk speak a language best translated in your tongue as 'Assimilated Pheromonal, Anatonmical, and Sonic Language,' or 'APASL.' It is a very insectoid mix of vocalized clicks, body language, and pheromone communication. To translate it into an entirely vocal language like your own, and back, you will require much more than what the Hai use. We also need to modify your ship to be able to receive their broadcasting frequencies."`
			`"How long will that take?" you ask.`
			`"It's already done, but we still should teach you how to do it yourself for any other ships you feel like using, and how to undo the changes for any ship you wish to sell," said the Pug.`
			`"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get started," you say.`
			`The Pug takes out some kind of handheld device with two forward-facing prongs. "Don't blink," it says.`
			`Too terrified to disobey, your eyelids somehow end up locked wide open. The Pug points the device at your eyes, and beams shoot from the prongs into your eyes for a few seconds. As it does so, you feel texbooks upon textbooks of new technical knowledge being shoved into your brain at once.`
			`"Done," the Pug says.`
			`You find yourself able to blink again, but you now also have a splitting headache.`
			`"Rest for however long you need. The Antfolk aren't going anywhere," the Pug said.`
			`You head back to your quarters and rest. Oddly, the moment your headache is fully gone, you hear the buzz of someone outside your ship requesting in.`
			`Groggily, you open your bay doors. A single Pug is standing there, in some kind of uniform. You never were good at telling individual Pug apart, but you suspect that this Pug is female.`
			`"Can I help you?" you ask.`
			`"We have elected to send one of us as a passenger on your ship, to provide useful advice when necessary," the Pug said.`
			`"For an extended stay, I presume?" you ask.`
			`"Yes," the Pug said, before amending the answe with "Sir."`
			`You give a long, tired sigh. "Find, fine. Come on in."`
			`You show the Pug to an empty bunk and storage locker. Then, you say "By the way, do you Pug have names? I'd rather not just call you 'Pug' for who-knows-how-long."`
			`The Pug thinks for a moment, then says "For your convinence, you may call me 'Steve'."`
			`You resist rolling your eyes, and say "Well, we'll be lifting off soon. Do whatever you need to, then meet me [on the bridge]."`

However, we soon learned that demons don't come from below, they come from above. A millenia ago, a massive metal monster descended from the skies. It burned the land and boiled the seas. Our only salvation from its wrath came when our [deity/goddess], the mighty {Giant Sky Spider}, also came down from the [skies/heavens] and banished Miasma from our world. It then gave us the sacred [Pipe Organ] of [Spirits/Souls] and instructed us in its proper use to prevent the return of Miasma.`
