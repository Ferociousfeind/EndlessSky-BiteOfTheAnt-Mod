		attributes antfolk
		landscape #land/something
		description `Aicmaer at first seemed like a perfectly habitable planet for the Antfolk without any terraforming. The planet also has a position in Antfolk space ideal for becoming an interstellar trade hub. Unfortunately, one massive problem is preventing it from growing beyond a few small settlements: the planet's weather is extremely strong, erratic, and almost completely unpredictable. As a result, the planet's settlements are small, and are all planetbases little different from what you'd find on a barren moon. Except, of course, that these planetbases are far more heavily-armored.`
		spaceport `It is a well-known fact in human space that moons help moderate the weather of the planets they orbit. Moons, like Luna, act as a sort of natural terraforming machine for the world they orbit, like Earth. Aicmaer lacks any kind of moon or other natural satellite of sufficient size to do this for it. As a result, Aicmaer has incredibly extreme weather patterns, to the point that you can't even leave your ship without an EVA suit. And, judging by the fact that the Antfolk at this spaceport are wearing various kinds of enviro suits as well, they don't seem to be doing much better.`

		description `Originally colonized by a small faction of political dissidents banished from the Antfolk Union, Laze Nu Eve, a barren planet with few resources of its own, has quickly become the central hideout of all the pirates now raiding on and off throughout Antfolk space.`
		description `Laze Nu Eve even has its own insect queen who seems to be a contender against High Queen Bringer of Law XVI, calling herself "Grand Queen Bringer of Chaos the First". Notably, the Antfolk here are not attacking you out of fear, lacking any of the respect or admiration you receive on other Antfolk planets.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is basically just a landing pad on stilts (should the ice under the landing pad break - which it won't - the pad itself should still function) with a walkway into the largest planetbase on the planet.`

		description `"OTMS" apparently stands for "Orbital Terraforming Management Station", and is an ingenius solution to Aicmaer's weather problems. By building as large a space station as they could, the Antfolk have basicly managed to build an artificial moon for Aicmaer that noticably tempers the planet's weather just by being there.`
		description `And yet the Antfolk did not invest so many resources into such a large space station just for it to sit there and be only marginally cheaper than a normal Glory terraforming machine. OTMS 1 also serves as a deuterium refinery using the local stars' solar winds, and teams of Antfolk scientists on the station run numerous tests and monitoring functions on the planet below to calculate when and how to adjust the planet's environment next.`
