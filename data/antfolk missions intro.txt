			`You settle your ship onto a landing pad in what appears to be the Pug's idea of a  spaceport. After exiting the <ship>, you are met with a sudden stare from some Pug nearby. One of them takes some device out of it's pocket and speaks into it.`
			`Soon after, a contingent of Pug guards surrounding a single, more formally-dressed, Pug approaches you. You notice that the formally-dressed Pug is holding a cuboid device.`
			`"At last, we meet," it says, speaking into the device, which seems to be a fairly simple translator. "Tell me, human traveller, what brings you to Pug space this time?" it asks.`
			`This Pug seems far more talkative than they have previously been. You might be able to get some answers about them if you play it's game.`

			`	"We will provide you with a translator for the language of this species," the Pug says, who is now looking at you, waiting for an answer."
