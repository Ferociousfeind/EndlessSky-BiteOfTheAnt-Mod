planet "Ad Elans" #anagram for "Atlantis"
	attributes antfolk
	landscape land/sea1
	description `Ad Elans is home to the oldest off-homeworld colonies the Antfolk have. Due to the planet's surface being ninty-percent water, there is little enough arable land that the Antfolk have instead built floating cities that ride the ocean currents, fishing for what resources they can and getting the rest from stationary mining ports.`
	spaceport `Due to the heavy space traffic Ad Elans recieves, the city the spaceport is on one of the largest platforms of the largest and oldest of the mobile floating cities sailing the planet's oceans. While the Antfolk's choice to do this rather than letting docked ships take up valuable landmass makes sense, it has the side effect that ships can only land on one specific part of the planet, and which part that is constantly changes. As a result, traffic controllers have to stay in constant communication with the ships they're trying to help land, so as to send them new coordinates for the spaceport should they change significantly before the ship can find the correct floating city.`

planet Aicmaer #anagram for "America"
	attributes antfolk
	landscape #land/something
	description `Aicmaer at first seemed like a perfectly habitable planet for the Antfolk without any terraforming. The planet also has a position in Antfolk space ideal for becoming an interstellar trade hub. Unfortunately, one massive problem is preventing it from growing beyond a few small settlements: the planet's weather is extremely strong, erratic, and almost completely unpredictable. As a result, the planet's settlements are small, and are all planetbases little different from what you'd find on a barren moon. Except, of course, that these planetbases are far more heavily-armored.`
	spaceport `It is a well-known fact in human space that moons help moderate the weather of the planets they orbit. Moons, like Luna, act as a sort of natural terraforming machine for the world they orbit, like Earth. Aicmaer lacks any kind of moon or other natural satellite of sufficient size to do this for it. As a result, Aicmaer has incredibly extreme weather patterns, to the point that you can't even leave your ship without an EVA suit. And, judging by the fact that the Antfolk at this spaceport are wearing various kinds of enviro suits as well, they don't seem to be doing much better.`

planet "Laze Nu Eve" #can't recall for the life of me what on Earth that name is an anagram of
	attributes antfolk "antfolk pirate"
	landscape #land/something (probably something frozen wasteland-ish)
	description `Originally colonized by a small faction of political dissidents banished from the Antfolk Union, Laze Nu Eve, a barren planet with few resources of its own, has quickly become the central hideout of all the pirates now raiding on and off throughout Antfolk space.`
	description `Laze Nu Eve even has its own insect queen who seems to be a contender against High Queen Bringer of Law XVI, calling herself "Grand Queen Bringer of Chaos the First". Notably, the Antfolk here are not attacking you out of fear, lacking any of the respect or admiration you receive on other Antfolk planets.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is basically just a landing pad on stilts (should the ice under the landing pad break - which it won't - the pad itself should still function) with a walkway into the largest planetbase on the planet.`
